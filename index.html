                    Many years earlier, Sangathamizhan and his family including his lover and cousin,
                     Thenmozhi stopped the launch of Sanjay's copper factory in their village due to the toxic effects on the villagers
                      caused by the waste from the factory. In retaliation, Sanjay killed Sangathamizhan and his family with the help of Kulandaivel,
                       who is a fellow politician and the former best friend of Sangathamizhan's father during a festival.
